### Select

Select is used to **read** data from the table.

We can read all of the data at the same time using "*"

```SELECT * FROM Table_Name```

We can specified just the columns we want to read

```SELECT Column1, Column2 FROM Table_Name```

We can setup a condition using Where:

```SELECT * FROM Table_Name WHERE field = value```
